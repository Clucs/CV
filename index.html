            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <br>
            <p>When Loid met Anya for the first time in the orphanage: she wore a simple black dress with a white ribbon at the front, along with white folded-down socks and black shoes. She also wears two black hair ornaments with bright yellow embellishments that resemble small horns on the sides of her head. Anya is never seen with her hair ornaments off, even wearing them to sleep.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At Eden Academy, Anya wears the standard uniform with white knee-high socks and black Mary Janes. She carries around a brown schoolbag with a sheep keychain attached. During physical education class, Anya also ties her hair back with a red headband and wears the school gym uniform, along with white socks and white gym shoes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When she was younger, her hair was slightly shorter and she did not wear the horn-like hair ornaments, instead, her hair was tied into small buns at the sides of her head. She also wore clothing that resembled scrubs</p>

        <div id="personality">
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As a young child, Anya is very impressionable towards the people around her. For instance, reading Loid's mind and acting in ways he found very odd and learning how to punch from Yor. Given her telepathic ability ostracizing her from people and her many foster homes, she instantly took to "Twilight" for being a real spy. Since being adopted, she wanted to go wherever Loid was going in hopes of seeing the spy stuff she always sees on TV. But, after the events of Chapter 1, she has learned of the harshness of espionage and stopped messing with Loid's spy work. She is quite clever being able to spell long words by herself and helping Loid out as best she can, even nudging Loid and Yor together. She likes watching spy cartoons, her favorite being "Spy Wars", and is often seen watching them whenever she can.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Anya has been longing for a loving family, as her previous families have most likely abandoned her. This has left her with some abandonment issues, as she cried at the thought of Loid replacing her and asking him not to leave her behind. This is further proven by how she lied about her age so she can be adopted by Loid so he can do his mission.</p>
            <br>
            <p>From her time as an experiment subject, Anya has a fear of people knowing she is a telepath. Resulting in her gaining deep mental scars at a very young age.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Due to being raised as an experiment subject, Anya does not have very good social skills and cannot have normal communication with people, she has also shown a severe lack of situational awareness & common sense at times. Because of this, she tends to be completely honest, always saying and reacting people's inner thoughts which usually leads her to initiate involuntary conflicts with others. Nevertheless, Anya possesses a kind and emphatic side, proven when she calmed down a cow after learning through his telepathy that it was scared.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Being adopted by Loid and forming a family with him and Yor has made Anya feel genuinely happy. Due to finally being able to have that innocent and peaceful life she's always wanted to have but it was taken away from her.</p>
